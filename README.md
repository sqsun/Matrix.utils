# Matrix.utils

`Matrix.utils` is an R package which has been removed from the CRAN repository years ago. But many R packages depend on this, we archived on GitHub, 2023-12-09


## How to install / use

To use this development version of the package, run the following lines in R:
```R
devtools::install_github('sqsun/Matrix.utils', build_vignettes=TRUE)
library('Matrix.utils')
```
(You may need to install the package `remotes`, with `install.packages('remotes')`. Installation took <90s on a Macbook Pro.)

This should load all of the code and relevant documentation.
